# Socket Programming Projects

This repository contains practical implementations of core **socket programming** concepts, showcasing how network communication works at a low level. Each project is designed to help you understand and apply socket-based communication between machines and services.

## 📘 Description

### Topics Covered:

- **🔁 Inter-Machine Communication**  
  Establish a connection between two machines (client-server model) to exchange messages using TCP sockets.

- **📧 SMTP Email Sending**  
  Use socket programming to interact with an SMTP server and send emails by constructing and sending appropriate SMTP commands.

## 📁 Contents

- `inter_machine_communication/` – Example projects demonstrating basic socket connection and message exchange.
- `smtp_email_sending/` – Example of how to use sockets to connect to an SMTP server and send an email.

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Basic knowledge of networking concepts
- Internet connection (for SMTP-related examples)
